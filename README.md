# Discourse #

## Description ##

The activity DisCourse offers the possibility to conduct group discussions in a multi-step procedure.

Based on the concept of the pyramid discussion, the participants of the course initially write their own text on the discussed topic in a first phase. In the next two phases, they then combine their own position with those of other participants and thus develop more differentiated texts incorporating other points of view. Finally, in the last phase, all course participants collaborate to develop a final position on the discussed topic based on their previous results.

In this way, this activity enables the course participants to work together to develop arguments and perspectives on a topic and to weigh them against and with each other in order to develop differentiated positions on a complex topic in a reflexive exchange.
